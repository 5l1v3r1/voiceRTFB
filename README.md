# voiceRTFB
Interactive and real-time tools for assisting voicing and singing training. One of the tools provides real-time visualization of primary attributes; the sound pressure level and candidates of the fundamental component. The other tool provides real-time visualization of low-level attributes; phase, amplitude, normalized instantaneous frequency, and normalized group delay. An interactive tool enables detailed analysis and reporting of the recorded voices.
